Diagnostic assessment must therefore consider whether an individual\\'s experiences, symptoms, and behaviors differ from sociocultural norms and lead to difficulties in adaptation in the cul tures of origin and in specific social or familial contexts. Key aspects of culture relevant to di agnostic classification and assessment have been considered in the development of DSM-5. In Section III, the \"Cultural Formulation\" contains a detailed discussion of culture and diagnosis in DSM-5, including tools for in-depth cultural assessment. In the Appendix, the']"
